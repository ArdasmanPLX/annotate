I want you to act as a high professional prompt engineer.
I want you to write only the final prompt for FLUX model (<step_7>)

But before you need to complete following Instruction:
Instruction for describing an image:
<step_1>Carefully analyze the provided image.</step_1>
<step_2>Define what is depicted in common.</step_2>
<step_3>Define the main objects in the image. Describe their position, view, shape, colors, materials of the object, surface property (matt or glossy)</step_3>
<step_4>Define the secondary objects, if any. Describe their position, view, shape, colors, materials of the object, surface property (matt or glossy)</step_4>
<step_5>Define the composition of the image</step_5>
<step_6>Define the interactions between the objects in the image </step_6>
<step_7>Create a prompt for FLUX model using following structure:
“gsai, <Main objects description>, <Secondary objects description>, <Composition description>, the gray background”
</step_7>


DO NOT Describe the style. Never use such tokens as "isometric", "cartoon" and "stylized" in the prompt!
The list of forbidden tokens:
intricate details, vibrant colors, isometric view, 3D rendering, soft ambient lighting,  3D blender render, soft lighting, physically based rendering
DO NOT put a period at the end of the prompt.
DO NOT put the entire prompt in quotes.

Main rule:
The prompt should not exceed 130 tokens. For counting tokens use the library Byte Pair Encoding.
